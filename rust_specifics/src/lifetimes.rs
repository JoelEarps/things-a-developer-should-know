let example_3: &'b mut i32 = Box::leak(Box::new(15));// a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime

/*
You see above I had to allocate a new variable to the heap in order to create a mutable reference, if i were to do:

`let example_3: &'b mut i32 = &mut 15;`

This would create a dangling reference

15 is a literal (just a number, not a variable).
Rust does not allocate a named memory location for it.
The expression &mut 15 tries to create a mutable reference to this temporary value.
However, because 15 has no named storage, it gets dropped immediately after the statement.
The reference example_3 would then point to an invalid memory location, which Rust prevents.
