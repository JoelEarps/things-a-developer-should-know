# Breaking down hour long coding sessions

Interviews and small coding tasks often can be hard, you get stuck nervous etc

## Process to follow

### 0. Clarify (2-3 minutes)

- Ask clarifying questions: input constraints, edge cases, expected behavior
- Restate the problem in your own words to confirm understanding
- Identify what success looks like, using your own input, is there anything else we should be concerned about?

### 1. Plan (5-8 minutes)

- Don't jump straight into code
- Talk about the problem using a custom input/output example to show full understanding
- Walk through the example step-by-step
- Identify immediate edge cases (empty input, single element, boundaries, nulls)
- Consider constraints (time/space limits, input size)

### 2. Design Algorithm (5-8 minutes)

- Describe the algorithm you're going to use and what each step means
- Create pseudo code or high-level steps
- Discuss trade-offs between different approaches if multiple exist
- Explain why you chose this approach

### 3. Write Code (25-30 minutes)

- As you write, talk through what you're doing
- Reference your pseudo code as you implement each section
- **Start with a working solution, not the optimal one** (get it working first!)
- Use clear variable names and comments
- Keep talking - explain your thinking process

### 4. Test & Verify (5-8 minutes)

- Walk through your code with the example from step 1
- Trace through edge cases manually
- Look for bugs, off-by-one errors, boundary issues
- Consider writing test cases if time allows

### 5. Analyze & Optimize (remaining time)

- Identify bottlenecks using space and time complexity analysis
- Discuss current complexity: O(n), O(n²), O(1), etc.
- If time allows, refactor to improve
- Discuss further optimizations even if you don't implement them
- Mention what you'd do differently given more time

## Key principles

- **Communicate constantly** - your interviewer wants to see your thinking
- **It's okay to be wrong** - catch mistakes yourself, explain fixes
- **Start simple** - working code > perfect code that doesn't work
- **Time box** - don't get stuck on one phase too long
