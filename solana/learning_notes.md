### Blockchain basics

A blockchain is a distributed database.

There is no central authority, everyone can make payments and no one entity can reverse or change them. They are censorship resistant, tx's are irreversible.

There is no single copy of the blockchain, it is distributed around the world with copies on various nodes.

Decentralisation - direct interaction peer to peer. This is enabled by having variaces sources of truth validated by other nodes

Normally when using a centralised system you often are dependent on a middle man that charge fees.

Bitcoin was the original blockchain that allowed people to make a trusted transaction without using a centralised third party.

Blockchains depend on signatures to verify and perform transactions.

Smart contracts are programs that run on the blockchain. They are like APIs, but they are invoked by instructions on solana. Data is then written out to the blockchain.

### Cryptography and Blockchain

Everyone who uses a blockchain has a public and a private key.

A public key can be seen by anyone, it is used as an address for people ot interact with you.

Private key is a secret - it is used to sign transactions to prove that you make them.

Anyone else can use the public key to validate your transaction.

Very similar to passports.

In solana everyone has a public key that they can use to interact with you. You interact with address via instructions.
