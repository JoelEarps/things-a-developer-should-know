Must Knows

Arrays – a data structure that store data, usually of the same type in a contiguous block of memory.

Advantages of arrays:

1. As they are stored in contiguous memory that have fast access times.

Disadvantages:

1. As they are stored in contiguous memory, it is costly to resize them.
2. Typically store data of one type only.
