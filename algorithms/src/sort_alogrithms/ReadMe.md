# Sorting Algorithms

On the whole there are 5 different types:

1. Bubble
2. Merge
3. Quick
4. Select and Insert
5. Topological Sort

## Sorting in Rust

The standard library comes with Sort, this is available when a data structure implements the `Ord` trait.
Below is a table, with all the sorting algorithms used in rust, the algorithm it is based on, a small description, the O(N) time complexity, and use case notes.

This is all based on the std library v1.83.

_Assumption_: v is the vector type being sorted
